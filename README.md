## Why Menu Bar Apps?

Menu bar apps are the secret weapon of macOS. They’re lightweight, always accessible, and great for solving quick, everyday problems. Whether it’s checking the weather, renaming files, or monitoring your Wi-Fi, menu bar apps keep things simple and useful.

But let’s be honest: getting started isn’t simple.

- No "menu bar app" option in Xcode.  
- Tutorials are outdated.  
- Features like Quit buttons aren’t obvious.

This starter kit is here to fix all that.
